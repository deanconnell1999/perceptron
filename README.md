# perceptron
An implementation of the Perceptron machine learning algorithm from scratch in Python. This algorithm was tested against the Scikit Learn Perceptron implementation, and recorded higher performance scores on the same dataset over all metrics compared.
I worked on this project with a fellow student as part of the module requirements for Principles of Machine Learning, while studying a M.Sc. in Computer Science (Data Analytics) in NUI Galway.
